## Prerequisites

- Access to a [Parafin dashboard](https://dashboard.parafin.com)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Instructions

### 1. Clone repo

First, clone the quickstart repository and install dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/buildparafin/embedded-demo.git
$ cd embedded-demo
$ npm install
```

### 2. Fetch and include API keys

Next, Navigate to the [Settings > API keys](https://dashboard.parafin.com/settings/api-keys) in your Parafin dashboard and fetch your sandbox Client ID and Client secret.

Rename the `sample.env` file to `.env` and populate with your Client ID and Client secret.

```bash
$ mv sample.env .env
```

```bash
# .env
PARAFIN_CLIENT_ID="<your-client-id>"
PARAFIN_CLIENT_SECRET="<your-client-secret>"
```

### 3. Create a pre-approved offer

There are a few requirements before you can display a pre-approved offer with @parafin/react:

- Create a [Business](https://docs.parafin.com/capital/share-data/methods/api#2-create-a-business), [Person](https://docs.parafin.com/capital/share-data/methods/api#3-create-a-person), and [Bank Account](https://docs.parafin.com/capital/share-data/methods/api#4-create-a-bank-account)
- [Generate a Capital Product Offer](https://docs.parafin.com/api#tag/Sandbox/operation/Generate%20Capital%20Product%20Offer) for the newly created Business
- Replace the `personId` in the `App.js` file with the ID from your newly created Person (`person_xxx`)

See [our documentation](https://docs.parafin.com/capital/present-offers/embedded/) for more detailed information on how to create a pre-approved offer.

### 4. Run the app

You're now ready to run the app and check out your embedded offer!

In the project directory, run:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app with an embedded Parafin Widget in your browser.
